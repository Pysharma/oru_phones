# oru

A new Flutter project.

Oru Phones is a Flutter assignment project that encompasses four main screens in the Dart file and includes a custom AppBar widget.

Home Screen:
The Home Screen serves as the app's main entry point and features essential sections in the AppBar, including a drawer section for navigation and a notification section for important updates. The body of the Home Screen is designed to be vertically scrollable, comprising two primary sections:
Brand Section: A visually appealing vertical scrollable section that showcases various phone brands and their corresponding details.
Shop By Section: Another vertical scrollable area that allows users to explore products based on specific categories or filters.
Additionally, the Home Screen displays a horizontal scrollable product carousel, which retrieves product data from the provided API. The product carousel is thoughtfully designed to meet the requirements specified in the assignment, ensuring an immersive and engaging user experience.

Furthermore, the Home Screen features a search section that provides smart search functionality. As users enter the first three letters of their search query, a list of relevant options dynamically populates, allowing for efficient and intuitive search interactions.

Filter Screen:
The Filter Screen is a dedicated page that fetches data from the API and displays various filter options to the user. These filters enable users to refine their product search based on specific criteria such as brand warranty, seller warranty, verification status, and more. The Filter Screen presents a user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to customize their search and find exactly what they are looking for.

Notification Screen:
The Notification Screen offers users quick access to important updates and alerts. When users tap on the notification section in the AppBar, they are redirected to this screen, where they can view relevant notifications in a clear and organized manner.

The Oru Phones project is designed to meet the assignment requirements with meticulous attention to detail and a focus on delivering a seamless user experience. The implementation adheres to the design specifications provided in the assignment, ensuring a visually pleasing and functional mobile application. The project utilizes Flutter's powerful features and widgets, showcasing the potential of this versatile framework for building sophisticated and user-friendly apps.
